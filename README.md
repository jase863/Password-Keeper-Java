# Overview

This program is a password keeper written using Java. It allows users to login with their username and password, after which they can add new passwords, view current passwords, edit passwords as needed, delete passwords, and change their master login credentials.

I wrote this program to demonstrate my ability to use Java, as well as create an app that I can use to store my passwords locally.

# Future Work

- Implement more methods into my classes, rather than writing them in the main program file
- Go back and close Scanners that read user input
- Write a method that allows the user to switch files if they have multiple files
